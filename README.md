# Battle-Network

small attempt at a battle network I made when I was newer, saved the code in case I wanted to expand the project 

please note that I stopped working on this right before making this a "true" card system. 
So the cards are always drawn from 1 of the 40 cards in the deck, and the cards that you have in your hand don't matter.
